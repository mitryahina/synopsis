# synopsis
Synopsis is UCU students' project meant to actualize auto-referring and summarizing text for Ukrainian language. The idea is not to just summarize text, but provide some useful tools for vizualizing information, such as searching for the illustrations of the main characters(extracted from the text), and showing diagrams and generated infographics for better comprehending. In the future we also plan to develop the "comprehending" part of the project, including voicing and selection of soundtracks.
